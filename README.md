# 🏦 Banking Customer Creditworthiness Score Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

Banks must decide whether to approve or reject loan applications based on a customer’s ability to repay.  
Wrong decisions can lead to financial loss or missed business opportunities.

This project aims to predict the **creditworthiness of banking customers** using their financial and personal information, helping banks make faster and more accurate loan approval decisions.

The system analyzes customer behavior patterns and classifies whether a customer is likely to be a **good or risky borrower**.

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze customer financial and demographic data  
- Identify patterns linked to loan repayment behavior  
- Predict whether a customer is creditworthy  
- Support banks in reducing loan default risk

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset is stored separately on **Google Drive** due to file size and access convenience.

### 🔗 Dataset Location:
👉 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sD7IgFihj10C-4nqUroCTrCUr12wxTrm?usp=sharing

### Dataset Contains:

- Customer demographic details  
- Employment and income information  
- Loan history and credit behavior  
- Financial indicators affecting repayment ability  

Each row represents one banking customer with multiple attributes used for risk assessment.
